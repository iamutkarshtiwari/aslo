## Sphinx setup

If you require sphinx to be setup (either you are setting up a production
Sphinx box, or are testing our implementation of Sphinx) you have a few
options

### Install

You can install sphinx either by using fabric or manually. If you don't have
fabric, follow the manual instructions.

#### via fabric

Fabric is an ant-like task system for python. In the bin directory you can
tweak the `INSTALL_ROOT` in `fabfile.py` and then run `fab install_sphinx`.

#### via Source

1.  Download sphinx
http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads/sphinx-0.9.9-rc2.tar.gz
2.  `tar zxf sphinx-0.9.9-rc2.tar.gz`
3.  `cd sphinx-0.9.9-rc2`
4.  `./configure;make;make install`

Note: if you are installing on `khan` be sure to use the `--prefix` option.

### Configuration

Copy `site/app/config/sphinx.conf-dist` to `/opt/local/etc/sphinx.conf` (or
whatever your `etc` directory is) and adjust the database settings as
necessary:

    type     = mysql
    sql_host = localhost
    sql_user = root
    sql_pass = 
    sql_db   = remora

You may also want to search/replace `/opt/local/` with a path of your choice.

### Create the sphinx index

    indexer --all --rotate
    
The index and log files will be stored in `/opt/local/data/sphinx/` and
`/opt/local/log/searchd/` respectively by default.

### Run the daemon

    searchd
