      Contributions to users and (ii) maintain and/or update your AMO

     <strong>Management of AMO Services.</strong>
     Mozilla may manage the AMO Services in a manner designed to facilitate the
     integrity and proper functioning of the AMO Services without limitation or
     liability. The following is a list of exemplary activities that Mozilla in
     its sole discretion may undertake as part of its management of the AMO
     Services: (i) monitor, test and review AMO Contributions; (ii) remove or
     disable AMO Contributions or change their listing or description; (iii)
     move an AMO Service and related AMO Contributions to a new domain or
     website; (iv) rate limit, throttle and/or block requests or access to any
     AMO Service; (v) use, modify or remove authentication requirements for
     access to AMO Services; and (vi) collect statistics and other data
     regarding your AMO Contribution, which may be made publicly available
     through the AMO API (as described below).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>AMO <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</strong>
      As part of the AMO Services, Mozilla provides the addons.mozilla.org API
      (&#8220;<strong>AMO API</strong>&#8221;), which allows you to get
      information about certain AMO Contributions distributed by Mozilla via the
      AMO Service and is currently served via calls to
      https://services.addons.mozilla.org/api/.
      You may use the AMO API solely to retrieve data made publicly available by
      Mozilla via the AMO API, which data may be used solely for your own
      reasonable business purposes or personal use. In addition to the
      restrictions otherwise set forth in the Terms regarding AMO Services
      generally, you agree that you are responsible for your use of and
      contribution to the AMO API and you will not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        hide or mask from Mozilla the identity of your service as it uses the
        AMO API, including by failing to follow required identification
        conventions; or
      </li>
      <li>
        use the AMO API for any application that replicates or attempts to
        replicate the Mozilla AMO Service or experience
        unless your use of the AMO API is non-confusing. By non-confusing,
        Mozilla means that people should always know with whom they are dealing
        and where the information or software they are downloading came from.
        Websites and software that are not produced by Mozilla shouldn’t imply,
        either directly or by omission, that they are.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Mozilla grants you the right to do so. Mozilla and its licensors reserve

        under these Terms will not exceed $500 (five hundred dollars). Some
