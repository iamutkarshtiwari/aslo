<h2>What is addons.mozilla.org?</h2>
<p>
  addons.mozilla.org (AMO) is Mozilla's official site for add-ons for Mozilla
  applications.  Add-ons let you add new features to Firefox, Thunderbird,
  SeaMonkey, and Sunbird.  From AMO, you can browse and download thousands of
  add-ons to change the way you use the internet.
</p>

<h2>Who creates these add-ons?</h2>
<p>
  The thousands of add-on developers range from individual hobbyists to large
  corporations.  All public add-ons are reviewed by a staff of dedicated
  volunteers before being released.  Experimental add-ons are marked as such and
  have not been reviewed.
</p>
