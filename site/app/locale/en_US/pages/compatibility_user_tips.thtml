<ul class="tips">
    <li>While many add-ons can support the changes in %s without any code modifications, others may require additional work by the authors to ensure a smooth upgrade. Please be patient during this time, as many add-on developers maintain their add-ons voluntarily as a hobby.</li>
    <li>Mozilla discourages disabling the compatibility check setting, as this can lead to serious problems starting up %s and even data loss if an extension not compatible with a new version of %s is forced to be used.</li>
    <li>If the extension you're trying to use is not compatible after %s is launched, you may want to check its website or author's homepage for any news concerning the update.</li>
    <li>You may also want to look for an add-on with similar functionality that does support %s on the <a href="%s">%s Add-ons</a> website.</li>
