<h2>Mozilla Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>June 2008</p>

<p><i>Note: This privacy policy applies to the Mozilla.org Web sites and services. We have a separate privacy policy for our
products and for some Mozilla.com web properties. Please see for example: <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-en.html">Mozilla Firefox Privacy Policy</a>.</i></p>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

<p>Except as described below, the Mozilla Foundation ("Mozilla") does not collect or require visitors to
its Web sites to furnish personally-identifying information such as names, email addresses and phone numbers.
Like most Web site operators, Mozilla collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preferences, referring
site, and date and time of each visitor request. Mozilla also collects potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally identifying in and of themselves
but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.</p>

<p>Mozilla's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how Mozilla's visitors use
its Web sites. To that end, Mozilla may share potentially personally-identifying information with its
employees, contractors, and its subsidiaries and related organizations. Mozilla may also release
non-personally-identifying information about visitors (e.g., by publishing a report on Web site usage
trends). Otherwise, Mozilla will not publicly release potentially personally-identifying information
except under the same circumstances as Mozilla releases personally-identifying information. Those
circumstances are explained below.</p>

</div>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Community Members</h3>

<p>Certain members of the Mozilla community (contributors, customers, etc.) choose to interact with
Mozilla in ways that require Mozilla and others to know more about them. The amount and type of
information that Mozilla gathers from those members depends on the nature of the interaction. For
example, members who wish to post content to certain portions of Mozilla's Web sites or participate
in live chat session(s) are asked to provide usernames that identify that content as having been
posted by a particular member. Developers, by comparison, are asked to provide contact information,
up to and sometimes including telephone or fax numbers, so that they can be contacted as necessary.
Customers of the Mozilla store are asked to provide even more information, including billing and
shipping addresses and credit card or similar information. In each case, Mozilla collects
personally-identifying information only insofar as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the
community member's interaction with Mozilla.</p>

<p>Mozilla is an open organization that believes in sharing as much information as possible about
its products, its operations and its associations. Accordingly, community members should assume&mdash;as
should most folks who interact with Mozilla&mdash;that any personally-identifying information
provided to Mozilla will be made available to the public. There are three broad exceptions to that rule:</p>

<ol> 
<li>Mozilla does not publicly release information gathered in connection with commercial transactions
(i.e., transactions involving money), including transactions conducted through the Mozilla Store or
donations to the Mozilla Foundation.</li>

<li>Mozilla does not make publicly available information that is used to authenticate users the publication
of which would compromise the security of Mozilla's Web sites (e.g., passwords).</li>

<li>Mozilla does not make publicly available information that it specifically promises at the time of
collection to maintain in confidence.</li>

</ol>

<p>Outside those three contexts, visitors should assume that personally-identifying information provided
through Mozilla's Web sites will be made available to the public.</p>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Interactive Product Features</h3>

<p>Certain Mozilla products contain features that report, or that permit users to report, the user's
usage patterns and problems&mdash;whether caused by Mozilla's software, third party software, or
third-party Web sites&mdash;to Mozilla. The reports generated by these features typically include
non-personally-identifying information such as the configuration of the user's computer and the code
running at the time the problem occurred. Some of the features give users the option of providing
personally-identifying information, though none of these features require it. Some Mozilla software
features that do permit users to provide personally-identifying information advise, in advance, that
such information will not be made publicly available. Mozilla analyzes the information provided by
these interactive product features to develop a better understanding of how its products are performing
and being used. It does not use the information to track the usage of its products by identifiable
individuals.</p>

</div>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Where Mozilla has collected personally-identifying information subject to one of the three
exceptions described in the Contributors and Customers section, above, it discloses that information
only to those of its employees, contractors and its subsidiaries and related organizations that need
to know that information in order to process it on Mozilla's behalf and that have agreed not to disclose
it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and subsidiaries and related organizations may be
located outside of a visitor's home country; by using Mozilla's Web sites, the visitor consents to
the transfer of his/her information to them. Mozilla does not rent or sell such information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors or its subsidiaries and related organizations, as described
above, Mozilla discloses such information only when required to do so by law, or when Mozilla believes
in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mozilla,
members of the Mozilla community, or the public at large. Mozilla takes all measures reasonably
necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of such
information.</p>

</div>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Updating of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Mozilla permits users to freely update and correct their personally-identifying information as
maintained by Mozilla. To do so, users should look for links or contact information available on
whichever Mozilla Web sites store the relevant information (e.g., Bugzilla users should go to
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=account">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=account</a>),
or contact Mozilla by email.</p>

</div>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Cookies and Clear GIFs</h3>

<p><b>What Are Cookies?</b> A cookie is a string of information that a Web site stores on a visitor's
computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Web site each time the visitor returns.
Most major web sites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website
at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to "recognize" a browser when it
returns to the site. The domain name in Mozilla cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with
Mozilla and, where applicable, its third party service provider.</p>

<p><b>What Are Clear GIFs?</b> Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with
cookies to help web site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is
typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of
a clear gif allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the
clear gif. It makes it easer to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the
path of pages visited at a website.</p>

<p><b>How We Use Cookies and Clear GIFs.</b> Mozilla's Web sites use cookies and may use clear gifs in
the future. These tools help Mozilla identify and track visitors, their usage of Mozilla Web sites, and
their Web site access preferences across multiple requests and visits to Mozilla's Web sites. The basic
idea is to gather aggregate data about how people use the Mozilla Web sites. The term usually used to
describe this is "web analytics" and the cookies and clear gifs are the tools by which a website owner
collects this web analytics data. Mozilla will use the web analytics data only to determine aggregate
usage patterns for our Web sites as described above. The Mozilla Web sites (.org domains) do this
using Mozilla's own internal analytics software, and currently do not utilize third party service
providers. Mozilla uses the information provided by cookies and clear gifs to develop a better
understanding of how Mozilla's visitors use Mozilla's Web sites, and to facilitate those visitors'
interactions with Mozilla's Web sites. Mozilla may make the aggregate data it obtains publicly
available. If the data is made available, none of the information will be personally-identifying
information or potentially-personally-identifying information.</p>

<p><b>How to Control the Use of Cookies.</b> Mozilla visitors have the ability to accept or decline
cookies. Mozilla visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by Mozilla, its
contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking
to Mozilla's Web sites. Certain features of Mozilla's Web sites may not function properly without the
aid of cookies.</p>

<div class="corner-box"> <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>Mozilla may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be reflected on
this page. Substantive changes will also be announced through the standard mechanisms through which
Mozilla communicates with the Mozilla community, including Mozilla's
<a href="http://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/announce">"Mozilla-announce" mailing list</a> and
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.announce">newsgroup</a>.</p>
